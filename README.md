# Hardware Devices in PL on PYNQ Z2

In this repo we provide some tutorials to build in PL on PYNQ Z2 board some devices and communication protocol IP. Specifically we have integrated 4 IPs:
 - General Purpose I/O (GPIO);
 - Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C);
 - Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI);
 - Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART);

## Port usage and definition

For I2C, SPI and UART devices we have used PMODB, which is not shared with other elements of the board (in our specific board PMODA is shared with Raspberry Pi header). The pinout definition is shown in the following image:

As we can see in the previuos image, the first pin is in the high right corner of the module, the last one is in the left low corner.

For GPIO communication protocol we have used an Arduino header analog port of PYNQ Z2, specifically A0.
